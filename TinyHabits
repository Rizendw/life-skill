# Tiny Habits

## 1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

- **The “Maui Habit”:** — saying “It’s going to be a great day” when you put your feet on the floor in the morning.

- **Why it’s interesting:** It’s super small but shifts your mood instantly. That little positive start can trigger bigger, better habits. It shows that real change starts with tiny steps, not big struggles.

## 2. How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?

  To make habits easier:

- Lower the Ability bar: Make the habit so small it’s almost impossible to skip.
- Use a clear Prompt: Tie it to an existing routine (anchor).
- Don’t rely only on Motivation, since it fades quickly.
- MAP stands for:
  * M = *Motivation* → how much you want to do it.
  * A = *Ability* → how easy it is to do.
  * P = *Prompt* → the reminder/trigger that nudges you to start.

## 3. Why is it important to "Shine" or celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

- Habits stick because of emotions, not just repetition.
- Celebrating gives a small hit of dopamine, telling your brain the action felt good.
- Reinforcement works best if it’s immediate—smiling, fist pumping, or saying “Yes!” right after.
- Celebration builds intrinsic motivation—you do it because it feels good, not just because you “should.”

## 4. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

- The British Cycling Team story. By improving 1% in many areas—bike seats, sleep, hand-washing—they went from losing to winning the Tour de France.
- Lesson: Small daily improvements compound into massive success over time.

## 5. What is the book’s perspective about Identity?

- The book says the strongest way to form habits is to focus on identity, not just goals.
- Example: Instead of “I want to lose weight,” say “I am a healthy person.”
- When you see yourself as that type of person, your actions naturally follow.
- Identity reinforces habits, and habits strengthen identity.

## 6. How to make a habit easier to do?

- Remove friction so it takes very little effort.
- Break it into tiny steps (e.g., read 1 page, not the whole book).
- Prep your environment (e.g., keep running shoes by the door).
- Focus on small actions that feel almost automatic.

## 7. How to make a habit harder to do?

- Add friction so it’s inconvenient.
- Keep temptations out of reach (don’t buy junk food, or put it on a high shelf).
- Log out of distracting apps so you need extra effort to log back in.
- Make the process less comfortable or more time-consuming.

## 8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and/or response satisfying?

- *Habit:* Reading 10 minutes daily
- *Cue:* Keep the book on my pillow so I see it before bed.
- *Attractive:* Pick books I actually enjoy, not just “should” read.
- *Easy:* Commit to 1 page a day (usually I’ll read more).
- *Satisfying:* Track progress on a checklist/app and celebrate each read.

## 9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard, or the response unsatisfying?

- *Habit:* Scrolling on my phone late at night
- *Invisible:* Keep my phone in another room before sleeping.
- *Unattractive:* Remind myself how groggy I feel next day after scrolling.
- *Hard:* Log out of social apps so logging in takes extra effort.
- *Unsatisfying:* Tell a friend I’m avoiding late scrolling for accountability.
