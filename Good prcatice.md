# Good Practices for Software Development

## What We Learned That’s New
Here are a few things that stood out to us:

- Even with all the planning, requirements can still feel fuzzy. The best way forward is to get regular feedback while building so we stay on the same page.  
- Take a look at how big open-source projects handle issue reporting — there’s a lot we can learn from them.  
- Check teammates’ schedules before setting up calls. It makes collaboration much smoother.  
- Try to be available when someone replies to your message. Real-time chats usually get things done faster than slow back-and-forth.  
- Social media can be a huge distraction. Tools like **TimeLimit** or **Freedom** can help block them during work hours.  
- Tracking time with apps like **Boosted** can give us a clearer picture of how we’re working and where to improve.  

## Where We Can Get Better
Here are the areas we’d like to focus on improving:

- **Write cleaner code** – keep it simple and easy for others to follow.  
- **Optimize code** – make it run better and more efficiently.  
- **Communicate and collaborate** – work on being clear, responsive, and supportive as a team.  
- **Stay focused** – set aside distraction-free time for deep work.
