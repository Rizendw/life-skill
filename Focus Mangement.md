- Helps you master difficult skills faster.  
- Rare in today’s world of constant notifications — which makes it super valuable.

## Question 2  According to author how to do deep work properly, in a few points?
- **Work deeply** → set routines (time, place, rules for devices) so you don’t rely on willpower.  
- **Embrace boredom** → train your brain not to reach for distractions at the first sign of restlessness.  
- **Quit social media** → keep only the tools that bring real value, ditch the rest.  
- **Drain the shallows** → reduce low-value work (emails, random meetings) to make space for focus.

## Question 3  How can you implement the principles in your day to day life? 
- Block out 1–3 hrs for focus sessions (mornings work best). Treat them like meetings.  
- Work in a quiet, distraction-free place. Phone away, tabs closed.  
- Set clear goals → e.g., “write 500 words” instead of “work on essay.”  
- Stick to one task until time’s up (no multitasking).  
- Batch shallow work → check emails/messages only a few times a day.

## Question 4  What are the dangers of social media, in brief?  
- Constant distraction → breaks focus and weakens deep work.  
- Addiction → endless scroll keeps you hooked.  
- Shorter attention span → trains your brain for quick hits, not long focus.  
- Anxiety & comparison → curated highlight reels can make you feel worse.  
- Privacy concerns → personal data used for ads.  
- Sleep problems → using it late at night hurts rest and recovery.
