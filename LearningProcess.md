# Learning Process

## 1. What is the Feynman Technique?

The Feynman Technique is a way of learning where you explain an idea in simple words, as if you are teaching it to layman, to understand it better.

## 2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting story in the video is about how she struggled with Math and Science when she was young, but later retrained her brain and went on to become an engineer and professor.

The key idea is that learning tough subjects becomes easier when you use both focus mode (deep concentration) and diffuse mode (relaxed thinking), because this helps the brain connect ideas more effectively.

## 3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

- Active Mode

    - You focus fully on one topic with deep concentration.

    - In this mode, you may get stuck if the solution does not come quickly.

- Diffuse Mode

    - Your brain is relaxed and not working on the problem directly.

    - It helps create wider and more creative connections, often in unexpected ways.

    - This happens while doing other activities like walking, showering, or daydreaming.

## 4. According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

The video explains 4 steps to follow when starting a new topic:

- Break the skill into smaller parts.

- Learn just enough to self-correct.

- Remove barriers that stop you from practicing.

- Practice for at least 20 hours.

## 5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

- Use techniques like the Feynman Technique and Pomodoro Technique to understand and remember topics better.

- Avoid distractions by keeping my phone away during study time.

- Manage time properly to balance focused learning with rest and relaxation.
